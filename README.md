## Description

As a train system operator, I want to create, read, update, delete and list trains, so that I can track all of the trains in my system.

As a train system operator, I want to create, read, update, delete and list cities where my trains will stop, so that I can manage where all of the trains will go.

As a train rider, I want to view a train, so that I can see the cities where it stops.

As a train rider, I want to view a city, so that I can see which trains come to it.

As a train rider, I want to see a timetable that shows what time each train stops in each city.

As a train rider, I want to purchase a ticket in a particular city for a particular train so that I can get on and off in any city that train travels. (This can work like a MAX ticket where you are able to purchase the ticket independent of the destination).

There is a many-to-many relationship between cities and trains. You might consider naming the cities_trains join table stops to reflect the relationship between the two.

When you list out the trains for a specific city, you'll need to start by selecting all stops for that city, and then selecting all trains for those stops.
